    <h3>About the Demo (Updated 1/4)</h3>

    <h4>1/4 Update -> Both components now have <code>tabindex</code> being set
    in the constructor. This causes failures on 71+. Previous version of this Demo
    was only tested on chrome 64 and did not fail on 71+. Now that the code is updated,
    Test procedure has also been modified slightly as observed behaviours changed.</h4>
    All of these instructions can be minimized with the
    <strong>Toggle Instructions</strong> button
    <br/>
    <br/> This demo has 2 instances each of 2 components.
    <br/>
    <code>chromium-test-shadow</code> has our reproducer code within shadowDom.
    <br />
    <code>chromium-test-html</code> has our reproducer code within regular html (not shadowDom)
    <br /> Each of these components has 2 examples below. One where a function is passed in via
    <code>value</code> property, and one where it is not.
    <br /> There is a
    <strong>Refresh Demo</strong> button up top to reload the page in a clean slate, since this page may be statically hosted without
    fallbacks for history API, so this is a convience and alternative to hitting the browser refresh button.
    <br /> At the bottom, there is a button to
    <strong>Call __gCrWeb.message.getMessageQueue</strong>. The current observation is that if an "error" state is entered, calling
    this function will typically clear the errors from happening.

    <h3>Test Code</h3>

    Each component test below has 5 buttons which perform the same action across all examples.
    <ul>
      <li>a) Will fire a regular change event on the component</li>
      <li>b) Will fire a change event with composed/bubbles on the component</li>
      <li>c) Will will run our test which will either log succesfully or log exception message and strack trace</li>
      <li>d) Will will run (a) and then (c) syncronously</li>
      <li>e) Will will run (b) and then (c) syncronously</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Test Procedure (For chrome 71+)</h3>

    In order to reproduce, here are a few observations noted from playing
    <br/> (note: Refreshing between tests is recommended, but you can also play with the
    <code>getMessageQueue</code> function to reset states - this seems to work reliably)

    <ul>
      <li>In Examples (1) and (2), Click (a) then click (c) and the test will <strong style="color:red">fail</strong></li>
      <li>In Examples (1) and (2), Click (b) then click (c) and the test will <strong style="color:red">fail</strong></li>
      <li>In Examples (1) and (2), Click (d) <strong>TWO</strong> times and the test will <strong style="color:red">fail</strong></li>
      <li>In Examples (1) and (2), Click (e) <strong>TWO</strong> times the test will <strong style="color:red">fail</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>In Examples (3) and (4), no actions will fail the test from a clean slate</li>
      <li>In Examples (3) and (4), and having already caused a failure followig one of the above steps, clicking (c), (d), or
        (e) will cause a failure
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>For all examples, provoking a failure will cause (c) to always fail for all examples </li>
      <li>For all examples, after provoking a failure, clicking the _gCrWeb.message.getMessageQueue function will return force
        all examples to work the same as a clean slate</li>
      <li>After calling _gCrWeb.message.getMessageQueue, attempting to cause failures following 
        the above steps may not cause failures any longer
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Conclusions </h3>

    In conclusion the following is noted
    <ul>
      <li>No differences between shadow and non shadow components in v71+</li>
      <li>Test procuedure slighty different in chrome 64 vs chrome 71+</li>
      <li><code>this.setAttribute('tabindex',0)</code> is required in chrome 71+</li>
      <li>change event dispatch and function passed to 
        component (or parent / ancestor) required to reproduce bug
      </li>
    </ul>
